# algorithmic-trading
This project implements an automated trading strategy using SmartAPI to trade in the Indian stock markets. The algorithm identifies high-probability trade setups based on Opening Range Breakout (ORB) and volume-based filters, executing real-time trades with risk management mechanisms.

Features

 Automated Trade Execution – Places real-time buy/sell orders using SmartAPI.
 Historical & Live Data Processing – Fetches market data for decision-making.
 ORB & Volume-Based Trade Filtering – Identifies breakout opportunities.
 Risk Management – Implements position sizing, stop-loss, and square-off logic.
 Backtesting – Evaluates strategy performance using historical data.

 Tech Stack
	•	Python
	•	SmartAPI (Angel One API)
	•	Pandas, NumPy
	•	Order Execution & Risk Management
	•	Backtesting & Data Analysis
 
 Installation
 	1.	Clone the repository:
    git clone https://github.com/itsvikask4/algorithmic-trading
    cd your-repo-name

  2.  Install dependencies:
     pip install -r requirements.txt

  3.	Add your API keys in angel_keys.txt.
  4.	Run the script:
     python algo_trading.py


How It Works
	1.	Market Data Fetching: Retrieves historical and live price data using SmartAPI.
	2.	ORB & Volume Filters: Identifies potential breakouts based on the opening range.
	3.	Trade Execution: Places trades when breakout conditions are met.
	4.	Risk Management: Implements stop-loss, position sizing, and square-off logic.
	5.	Backtesting: Tests the strategy on historical data for performance evaluation.

 Backtesting
 
  To test the strategy on historical data, modify the script to fetch and analyze past market data before executing trades.
